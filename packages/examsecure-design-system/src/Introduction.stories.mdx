# Welcome to ExamSecure Design System

This ES Design System Documentation is developed using Storybook. Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.

The components developed in the `@examsecure/design-system` package are then used by the Candidate App and Educator App React applications. This allows a single source of truth for shared UI components and also makes it very easy to maintain these components. Currently, there are a limited number of components here. I'll keep on adding more components as and when needed.

This project is currently a <b>work in progress</b>. Please visit the [github repo](https://github.com/rajrajhans/examsecure) for more details.
